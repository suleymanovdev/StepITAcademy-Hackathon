Innovation Solutions Challenge

Creating the IUsta program.

The goal of the IUsta program is to unite professionals and clients in our country on one platform.
The program will consist of three parts: Admin, Master, and Client.
The Admin adds categories. The Master registers based on these categories and adds samples of their work.
The client's homepage should be similar to tap.az, for example.
The Client searches for a Master according to their preference and sends a work request to them.
After each agreement, an electronic receipt should be generated and sent to both parties via email, and the Admin should be able to view each of them when reviewing the statistics.
